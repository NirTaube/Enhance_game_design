# Enhance_game_design
Project Overview
Objective: To analyze player behavior and game performance to enhance game design and player experience.

Dataset: Since we don't have access to real-world gaming data, we'll create a simulated dataset representing player statistics and gameplay information. If you have access to a specific dataset or need a focus on a particular type of game, please let me know.

Steps:

Create a Simulated Dataset: Generate data representing players' statistics, game achievements, playtime, and other relevant metrics.
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
Feature Engineering: Extract new features that could provide deeper insights into player behavior or game performance.
Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset to identify trends, patterns, or correlations that could lead to improved game design or player engagement.
Innovation Proposal: Propose innovations or enhancements to the game based on the analysis.
Step 1: Create a Simulated Dataset
We'll generate a dataset that includes the following information for each player:

Player ID
Age
Gender
Hours Played
Game Level Reached
Number of Achievements
In-Game Purchases (amount)
In-Game Friends
Preferred Game Mode (e.g., Single Player, Multiplayer)
This data represents a mix of demographic information and in-game behavior.
